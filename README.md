# OddsViewer

Angular application to fetch and display betting odds for a range of football leagues. Odds are obtained via 'The Odds API' (https://the-odds-api.com/) and are displayed in a table against each match. Styling is handled by Bootstrap/Bootswatch.

I have also implemented a search facility, allowing users to filter the odds/matches by a particular team.
